## Quick Overview

Create easily a new Python project with simplified command.

The new python project will be generated by following the structure recommended by Ansys.

It will create a directory called `my-app` inside the current folder.<br>

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- pip
- pipx

This tool is compatible with Windows OS and Linux distributions.

## Usage

### Create new project 

### With pipx

```sh
pipx run ansys-create-python-project -n my-app 
```

[pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) is a package runner tool that that helps to run applications written in Python.
In fact, it uses pip, but is focused on installing and managing Python packages that can be run from the command line directly as applications. pipx requires
Python 3.6+ and need to be installed by [these instructions](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/).

It will create a directory called `my-project` inside the current folder.<br>
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:

```
my-project
├── README.md
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── LICENSE
├── flake8
├── pytest.ini
├── requirements.txt
├── package.json
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── .gitignore
├── .gitattributes
├── docker
│   ├── dockerfile
│   └── docker-compose.yml
├── doc
│   ├── images
│   |     └── img.jpeg
│   └── README.md
├── src
│   └── app.py
├── tests
│    └── test_app.py
└── examples
    └── README.md
   
```

No configuration or complicated folder structures, only the files you need to build your app.<br>
Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:

```sh
cd my-project
```

Inside the newly created project, you can run some other commands.

### Specify different template

The default generated project rely on the classic template. However, there are much more templates available.
To show the list of available template you can run the command below:

```sh
pipx run ansys-create-python-project --template
```

To specify a specific template (for instance a flask rest api) you can run:

```sh
pipx run ansys-create-python-project -n my-project -t flask-rest
```

### Run tests locally

The project newly created is done with a docker and a docker-compose files in the `/tests` folder. That enables to run 
all tests very easily in any environment without any additional requirements (only [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) 
and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are required).

To run the tests run the following command:
1. Move to /tests folder
2. Build the docker image
3. Start a container
4. Run the tests
5. Optional: Run specific tests suites thanks to the powerful pytest search feature

### Push your new project to git repository

1- Go inside the created directory by running 
```sh
cd ./my-project
```

2- Push this project in git remote repository"
```sh
git init

git remote add origin <git_repository_url>

git add . && git commit -m \"initial commit\"

git push origin main

```
