Module Documentation
====================

Create-Python-Project is a command-line tool so it shouldn't normally be imported.
However, it is MIT-licensed and if you wish to develop using it you can view
the auto-generated documentation here!

The package contains two primary modules: ``main.py`` and ``generator.py``.

generator.py
-------------

This contains most of the package's logic and covers template generation.

.. automodule:: src.generator
    :members:
    :show-inheritance:

main.py
-------

This contains the command-line interface logic as well as being the place
the program is actually run.

.. automodule:: src.main
    :members:
    :show-inheritance:
