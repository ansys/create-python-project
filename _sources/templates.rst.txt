Templates
=========

In General
----------

The details of which templates are currently available (and the files included) are shown below.
This list is generated from the templates available in the latest release.

Note: The "shared" template is not an actual template but a directory of files that is copied to
every template (hence "shared"). The only exceptions are that slightly different directory
structures are used for the CI/CD workflows depending on if you selected GitHub or ADO for your
CI/CD when you created your project.
